# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

React + Vite - Run Guide
This guide explains how to set up and run the React app using Vite.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
If you haven't already cloned the repository, use the following command:

git clone https://github.com/PRADHAN-SOURAV/ToDo-React.git
cd ToDo-React
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Once you're in the project folder, install the necessary dependencies using npm:

npm install
This will install all the required packages defined in package.json.

Step 3: Start Development Server
To run the app locally, use the following command:
npm run dev
Once the development server starts, you should see output similar to this:
VITE v4.0.0  ready in 200ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use `--host` to expose
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173/ to see your app in action.

That's it! You are now running the React app with Vite in development mode.
